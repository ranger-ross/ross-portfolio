# Ross's Portfolio

Project to show my programming journey and also ~~learn NextJS~~ :)

Edit: Since building this project in NextJS, I have learned that vanilla NextJS is not a great choice for a static content site. I have rebuilt this project in Astro ðŸš€

Deployed with Vercel to https://ross-portfolio.vercel.app/


## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
